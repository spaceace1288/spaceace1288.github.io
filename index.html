    <h1 style="text-align:center">Main Page</h1>
    <p class="description" style="text-align:center">You are viewing the main page for my Portfolio Site. Throughout this website, you can view my works, such as my games, programs and information about me. All you have to do is click on the title of the game or program being shown, that's classically blue and underlined! It's that easy! These pages are dynamic, so users have access to modifying the page to their liking simply by dragging and clicking certain "objects" on the page. For example
, under the section of games I've created, you could drag nearly any part of the "Unreborn" game object to move it. This includes the text, image, spaces in it and even a bit around the image itself! These objects also have dynamic backgrounds, that are a semi-3D experience. You can see it simply by dragging them near the center of the screen, and scrolling your page. You can also enjoy the view by "Scrolling off of the page"! There's plenty of space at the bottom of the page for sightseeing! Enjoy! Notes are shown throughout my site, but if they're irritating or if you generally just don't want to be forced to read them, there's a handy "Click me to view notes!" button at the top-left of each page. To load the static views of the page with no fancy dragging, click the blue link at the top-left of a page.</p>

    <!-- <p class="description">This portfolio site is meant to be a representation of my works, but right now, it's being worked on in the
  middle of learning Japanese, working on my game (Or to be more exact, a "Universal game system" made in GMS), classes and venting stress through playing games.
  Try coming back another day, probably tomorrow, and you'll see updates! For now, you can view my game, Unreborn, on Youtube. Link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1urEZiKh7_k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1urEZiKh7_k</a>
  The link provides version 6000 of my game. It is currently in version 7500. The version was previously reverted a couple of times due to issues with my budget (USB Size, neglecting data such as my work), Library computer reservation times ending, to be more exact, trying to save huge updates when I have two minutes of reservation time left. I save often, like 10-20 minutes earlier, but since I work so much and apply so many updates in such a short amount of time, just 10 minutes of lost data is enough to completely change something in my game. This applies to balancing, menus, gameplay and everything possible. Email: spaceace1288@gmail.com PSN: spaceace1288 steam: spaceace1288 Github:spaceace1288

<p class="description">Unreborn is my most notable success in indie video game design. It features mostly advanced mechanics over graphics. Examples of these mechanics include a complete stat system, the introduction of the Fury mechanic into my game, customizable status aliments, multi-influence physics systems, upgrades to your damage, defense, special regeneration, special abilities and weapons, and even grabbing allies into your arsenal!
What would make a completely mechanical game comparative to an artistic wonderland of stories? Unreborn is built upon reusability. It is reusable in the aspect of transforming it <b>instantly</b> into a hack-and-slash 2D platformer, an RPG, sidescrolling shooters and every category possible. Unreborn may currently be a bullethell sandstorm, but tomorrow, imagine you actually playing through a story, landing on those planets, making deals for unique gameplay items through shops,
fighting enemies and gaining territory on those planets with your recruited allies, not just in space? With <b>incredible emphasis</b> on reusability, Unreborn is transforming to confront issues with next-gen gaming. Saving random allies in the middle of nowhere could impact your journey, and every corner you check is unique. Coming in the future, game modes would feature a story capable of changing its experience across thousands of users, remaining fun and non-redudundant.

    <h1><a href="pages/Unreborn/Unreborn.html">Unreborn (Multi-Genre Hybrid Game)</a></h1>
    <p class="description">Unreborn is an intresting and unique take to video games. It is my first "real" success as an Indie Video Game Creator, and despite its looks, it's got alot going underneath the hood players won't even notice at first.
The game is mechanically advanced, focusing on gameplay rather than art. It holds <b>FOUR</b> different game types. These game types are:
<ol>
<li>Spaceship shooter</li>
<li>Top-down RPG</li>
<li>2D Action RPG Platformer</li>
<li>Top-down Strategy</li>
</ol>

  <h1><a href="pages/Unreborn.html">Unreborn (Top-down RPG)</a></h1>
  <p class="description">The top-down RPG component of the game occurs when the player lands on said planets, or other large landmasses from their spaceship. The player is able to navigate around land freely in top-down view. Using the WASD keys, sharing controls from the spaceship version of the game, players can move around and enter buildings and new areas. You can enter shops, caves, and even houses. Walking outside of a "town" or "village" puts your character on a larger map, where you see areas around you. In the field, walking for a certain amount of time initiates a battle. Battles cause the game to transition into 2D-platformer action. Upgrades and items bought outside of this (including spaceship and top-down parts) carry over into these battles, and dying in these battles could mean the end for your character! In a battle, the player mostly spawns in the middle of the field. Going to the edges of the field to the left or right enables the player to escape from the battle and transition back into top-down view, but the same enemy will appear on the map, and attempt to chase you. Escaping multiple battles could cause multiple enemies to be chasing you at once, and battle time progresses as if you were actually playing in real-time, so if one enemy catches up to you, and you spend too much time fighting them, other enemies also join the battle depending on their distance until they're all gone (or stopped chasing you). The field is very dangerous for this reason, and backtracking is very difficult, so if you're in a puzzle, take it seriously!

<h1 class="section">About me</h1>
<p class="description">Hello, my name is Chris Elisha Smith, and I am an Indie Video Game "creator". Online, I usually take the username of spaceace1288.
<ul>
<li>Name: Chris Elisha Smith</li>
<li>Email: spaceace1288@gmail.com</li>
<li>Github: https://github.com/spaceace1288/spaceace1288.github.io</li>
<li>Portfolio/Profile Page: spaceace1288.github.io</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center">Certifications</h2>
<p>Although I planned to hunt down more certifications, and generally wanted no less than 3 certifications every year at school, since I'm pitted in a trash school with unfair resources, these'll do unfortunately.</p>
<ul>
<li>98-361 MTA Software Development Fundamentals (C#)</li>
<li>Autodesk Certified User - Autodesk AutoCAD Certified User Exam</li>
<li>Autodesk Certified User - Autodesk Inventor Certified User Exam</li>
<p><b>I got all three of Microsoft's Office certifications in the same year, and only person to that year in my school!</b></p>
<li>Microsoft Office Word Specialist</li>
<li>Microsoft Office Powerpoint Specialist</li>
<li>Microsoft Office Excel Specialist (All three in the same year.)</li>
</ul>
<!-- </div> -->

<h2 style="text-align:center">Programming Languages</h2>
<p>I can program very efficiently and fast, unlike most other people. I tend to prefer originality over anything that requires me to credit others, which is why you'll see me build everything over from the bottom up instead of just taking someone's "catch on fire" code from another game. Because the concept of copyright is generally stupid in terms of code, if anyone else's name is mentioned in the code, it's an automatic dislike and no-return for me, <b>ESPECIALLY</b> in one of the few only available free youtube tutorial videos. My main programming languages are GML first, and right behind GML are Ruby, Java, C++, Javascript, HTML and CSS, GIT and C#.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ruby</li>
<li>Git</li>
<li>C++ (I'm pretty much done learning C++. Very almost)</li>
<li>*C# (I can only really read it, not write. I'll learn sometime if necessary.)</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Html and (CSS)</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>*Python (Was dropped due to waiting for class.)</li>
<li>GML Gamemaker Language (Making games now)</li>
</ul>

<p>And finally, me... As you can see, due to the inavailability of essential resources to someone like me(A proper and not crappy school, A library without 10-year-old computers, A school with a better mindset of people, broke, no proper government money, avoiding the dangers of everyday walking outside and suffocating from various toxins and getting robbed and decimated by my own community, name slandering, not owning proper work equipment currently for working on my game, and most of all, choosing strictly between a regular portion of food and a USB for more space to store my work, a new game that won't ask me to pay for DLC for an unfinished game, or new equipment..), I look more serious and really can't take anything negative people say, rather I ignore it.</p>
