  <p>This portfolio site is meant to be a representation of my works, but right now, it's being worked on in the
middle of learning Japanese (To play an actual game, Phantasy Star Nova), working on my game (Or to be more exact, a "Universal game system" made in GMS), classes and venting stress through playing games.
Try coming back another day, probably tomorrow, and you'll see updates! For now, you can view my game, Unreborn, on Youtube. Link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1urEZiKh7_k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1urEZiKh7_k</a>
The link provides version 6000 of my game. It is currently in version 7100. The version was previously reverted a couple of times due to issues with my budget (USB Size, neglecting data such as my work), Library computer reservation times ending, to be more exact, trying to save huge updates when I have two minutes of reservation time left. I save often, like 10-20 minutes earlier, but since I work so much and apply so many updates in such a short amount of time, just 10 minutes of lost data is enough to completely change something in my game. This applies to balancing, menus, gameplay and everything possible. Email: spaceace1288@gmail.com PSN: spaceace1288 steam: spaceace1288 Github:spaceace1288
Psst, I'm well aware of the page breaking if you resize it too small (or view on mobile), but I'm a bit busy!

    <h1>Unreborn</h1>
    <p class="description">Unreborn is my most notable success in indie video game design. It features mostly advanced mechanics over graphics. Examples of these mechanics include a complete stat system, the introduction of the Fury mechanic into my game, customizable status aliments, multi-influence physics systems, upgrades to your damage, defense, special regeneration, special abilities and weapons, and even grabbing allies into your arsenal!
What would make a completely mechanical game comparative to an artistic wonderland of stories? Unreborn is built upon reusability. It is reusable in the aspect of transforming it <b>instantly</b> into a hack-and-slash 2D platformer, an RPG, sidescrolling shooters and every category possible. Unreborn may currently be a bullethell sandstorm, but tomorrow, imagine you actually playing through a story, landing on those planets, making deals for unique gameplay items through shops,
 fighting enemies and gaining territory on those planets with your recruited allies, not just in space? With <b>incredible emphasis</b> on reusability, Unreborn is transforming to confront issues with next-gen gaming. Saving random allies in the middle of nowhere could impact your journey, and every corner you check is unique. Coming in the future, game modes would feature a story capable of changing its experience across thousands of users, remaining fun and non-redudundant.
