  <p>You are viewing the page for my main project, Unreborn.
</p>
<p class="description">Unreborn is my most notable success in indie video game design. It features mostly advanced mechanics over graphics. Examples of these mechanics include a complete stat system, the introduction of the Fury mechanic into my game, customizable status aliments, multi-influence physics systems, upgrades to your damage, defense, special regeneration, special abilities and weapons, and even grabbing allies into your arsenal!
What would make a completely mechanical game comparative to an artistic wonderland of stories? Unreborn is built upon reusability. It is reusable in the aspect of transforming it <b>instantly</b> into a hack-and-slash 2D platformer, an RPG, sidescrolling shooters and every category possible. Unreborn may currently be a bullethell sandstorm, but tomorrow, imagine you actually playing through a story, landing on those planets, making deals for unique gameplay items through shops,
fighting enemies and gaining territory on those planets with your recruited allies, not just in space? With <b>incredible emphasis</b> on reusability, Unreborn is transforming to confront issues with next-gen gaming. Saving random allies in the middle of nowhere could impact your journey, and every corner you check is unique. Coming in the future, game modes would feature a story capable of changing its experience across thousands of users, remaining fun and non-redudundant.

    <p class="description">Unreborn is a game consisting of several other games, all derived from the reusable code and setup given from its main part, the spaceship shooter. They are currently as follows: top-down RPG layout: 0.5/1 done, 2D Platforming Action-RPG combat: 0.2/1 done, Top-down strategy: 0/1 done, more to come. Because the main code can be built upon into several other projects, it creates a vast expansion of sub-games capable of being created.

  <h1><a href="pages/Unreborn.html">Unreborn (Top-down RPG)</a></h1>
  <p class="description">The top-down RPG component of the game occurs when the player lands on said planets, or other large landmasses from their spaceship. The player is able to navigate around land freely in top-down view. Using the WASD keys, sharing controls from the spaceship version of the game, players can move around and enter buildings and new areas. You can enter shops, caves, and even houses. Walking outside of a "town" or "village" puts your character on a larger map, where you see areas around you. In the field, walking for a certain amount of time initiates a battle. Battles cause the game to transition into 2D-platformer action. Upgrades and items bought outside of this (including spaceship and top-down parts) carry over into these battles, and dying in these battles could mean the end for your character! In a battle, the player mostly spawns in the middle of the field. Going to the edges of the field to the left or right enables the player to escape from the battle and transition back into top-down view, but the same enemy will appear on the map, and attempt to chase you. Escaping multiple battles could cause multiple enemies to be chasing you at once, and battle time progresses as if you were actually playing in real-time, so if one enemy catches up to you, and you spend too much time fighting them, other enemies also join the battle depending on their distance until they're all gone (or stopped chasing you). The field is very dangerous for this reason, and backtracking is very difficult, so if you're in a puzzle, take it seriously!
