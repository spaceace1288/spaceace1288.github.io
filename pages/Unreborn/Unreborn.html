    <p class="description" style="text-align:center">Unreborn is a game consisting of several other games, all derived from the reusable code and setup given from its main part, the spaceship shooter. They are currently as follows: top-down RPG layout: 0.5/1 done, 2D Platforming Action-RPG combat: 0.2/1 done, Top-down strategy: 0/1 done, more to come. Because the main code can be built upon into several other projects, it creates a vast expansion of sub-games capable of being created.</p>
    <h1 style="text-align:center">List of Unreborn Sub-games</h1>

      <div class="note">
  <p>You are viewing the page for my main project, Unreborn.
</p>
<p class="description">Unreborn is my most notable success in indie video game design. It features mostly advanced mechanics over graphics. Examples of these mechanics include a complete stat system, the introduction of the Fury mechanic into my game, customizable status aliments, multi-influence physics systems, upgrades to your damage, defense, special regeneration, special abilities and weapons, and even grabbing allies into your arsenal!
What would make a completely mechanical game comparative to an artistic wonderland of stories? Unreborn is built upon reusability. It is reusable in the aspect of transforming it <b>instantly</b> into a hack-and-slash 2D platformer, an RPG, sidescrolling shooters and every category possible. Unreborn may currently be a bullethell sandstorm, but tomorrow, imagine you actually playing through a story, landing on those planets, making deals for unique gameplay items through shops,
fighting enemies and gaining territory on those planets with your recruited allies, not just in space? With <b>incredible emphasis</b> on reusability, Unreborn is transforming to confront issues with next-gen gaming. Saving random allies in the middle of nowhere could impact your journey, and every corner you check is unique. Coming in the future, game modes would feature a story capable of changing its experience across thousands of users, remaining fun and non-redudundant.

    <p class="description">The spaceship shooter component of the game was the main testing grounds for most of the mechanics.
Unreborn intitially started as a spaceship shooter, mainly because of the art required for 2D Action-Platformer, but generally expanded later on. With the spaceship, the game essentially becomes a top-down shooter. Although it may be terrifying to see another game look like "another bullethell", Unreborn offers unique upgrades, weapons, allies and ship types to overcome the difference between your typical bullethell and game.
The player can recruit allied ships, which help them in combat. Holding left-shift in the default ship speeds the player up over time, allowing players to create unique pathing around projectiles. The player has various upgrades, such as increasing their firing rate and base damage: They can even just increase the damage of each individual projectile as they wish. They can upgrade their special bar, the ultimate, and special weapons. Base stats, such as your speed and health, may also be upgraded.

  <h1><a href="pages/Unreborn.html">Unreborn (Top-down RPG)</a></h1>
  <p class="description">The top-down RPG component of the game occurs when the player lands on said planets, or other large landmasses from their spaceship. The player is able to navigate around land freely in top-down view. Using the WASD keys, sharing controls from the spaceship version of the game, players can move around and enter buildings and new areas. You can enter shops, caves, and even houses. Walking outside of a "town" or "village" puts your character on a larger map, where you see areas around you. In the field, walking for a certain amount of time initiates a battle. Battles cause the game to transition into 2D-platformer action. Upgrades and items bought outside of this (including spaceship and top-down parts) carry over into these battles, and dying in these battles could mean the end for your character! In a battle, the player mostly spawns in the middle of the field. Going to the edges of the field to the left or right enables the player to escape from the battle and transition back into top-down view, but the same enemy will appear on the map, and attempt to chase you. Escaping multiple battles could cause multiple enemies to be chasing you at once, and battle time progresses as if you were actually playing in real-time, so if one enemy catches up to you, and you spend too much time fighting them, other enemies also join the battle depending on their distance until they're all gone (or stopped chasing you). The field is very dangerous for this reason, and backtracking is very difficult, so if you're in a puzzle, take it seriously!

  <p class="description">Whenever the player travels outside of a town in the top-down RPG part of the game, they're in danger of encountering unique enemies. If the player travels for a certain time, they enter a battle. Initially, the battle takes the form of a 2D Action-platformer/Hack-n-slash, but there's a unique mechanic that makes this different from other games. Upon filling a gauge, the player is able to "change the mode". The enemies can do this too. The two modes available are the 2D Action-platformer, and simply just real-time RPG. The difference between being able to dodge a devastating laser, and guaranteed strong attacks after three turns, and being a ninja and suspending enemies through stunlocks is huge. Stronger enemies may tend to always try to force the player into the RPG mode, just to land all their damaging abilities in conjunction! However, a pure damage difference and levels can be ignored just by filling up your gauge, and cancelling switches to the RPG mode. Initially, the player will lose this gauge whenever they take damage, with gauge loss multiplying upon every hit.

<h1 style="text-align:center" class="section">Unreborn Mechanic systems</h1>
<p class="description" style="text-align:center, position:relative">In Unreborn, there are plenty of unique mechanics available globally across all game types, like the Fury mechanic and specials. However, there are also unique mechanics specific to each game type, like the ability to change between an RPG and 2D-platforming-hack-n-slash. The global mechanics may work a little differently in each game type, but their effects are essentially the same. For example, in the spaceship shooter, Fury is a mechanic that's activated upon killing an enemy with your special weapon by default. In the 2D Action-platformer, there aren't any "special weapons" such as sawblades and buckshots, but there are unique moves, combos and special attacks unique to each weapon and class. Instead of having to kill enemies by wasting 250 of your special bar to keep the Fury mechanic going, it activates upon killing any enemy now with anything. What's the best part about the Fury in the 2D action-platformer? The fury you gain is permanent and undepletable! Sadly, however, great power comes at a great price. Upon accumulating fury, the player gains speed, damage and unique special effects, but they also lose resistances.

    <h1><a href="pages/Unreborn.html">Global Mechanics</a></h1>
    <p class="description">These mechanics may work a bit differently across each game type, but they are generally the same in effect:
<ol>
  <li>Fury</li>
  <li>Special</li>
  <li>Ultimate</li>
  <li>Health</li>

</ol><br>
  Fury: Upon killing an enemy, gain a stack of fury. Every stack of fury gives the player additional damage, special gain upon another fury stack, and increases its duration.<br><br>
  Special: A gauge linked to many actions. Regenerates constantly over time, but may regenerate slower after certain moves and effects hit the player.<br><br>
  Ultimate: After a set time, the player's ultimate becomes available. Press the spacebar to unleash it! Upon gaining kills with your ultimate, it temporarily grows in power, effect and duration, for up to a few stacks maximum.<br><br>
  Health: The amount of damage you can take. Upon reaching 0, guess what? You <bold>don't </bold>die! Instead, your player reaches a critical state, where you have a set time to resurrect yourself by healing the damage done to you (Take 250 damage, get -250 health, must heal 251 to revive). The player can still do everything as normal in this state, including defeating the boss and ending the battle! However, if the player doesn't heal that damage before the duration ends, it's game over!
   Every 100 damage you take pass 0 health is one second off of your revive timer, so 800 damage would mean no return, and 700 damage would mean only 1 second of revival time.
