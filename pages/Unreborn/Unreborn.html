  <p>You are viewing the page for my main project, Unreborn.
</p>
<p class="description">Unreborn is my most notable success in indie video game design. It features mostly advanced mechanics over graphics. Examples of these mechanics include a complete stat system, the introduction of the Fury mechanic into my game, customizable status aliments, multi-influence physics systems, upgrades to your damage, defense, special regeneration, special abilities and weapons, and even grabbing allies into your arsenal!
What would make a completely mechanical game comparative to an artistic wonderland of stories? Unreborn is built upon reusability. It is reusable in the aspect of transforming it <b>instantly</b> into a hack-and-slash 2D platformer, an RPG, sidescrolling shooters and every category possible. Unreborn may currently be a bullethell sandstorm, but tomorrow, imagine you actually playing through a story, landing on those planets, making deals for unique gameplay items through shops,
fighting enemies and gaining territory on those planets with your recruited allies, not just in space? With <b>incredible emphasis</b> on reusability, Unreborn is transforming to confront issues with next-gen gaming. Saving random allies in the middle of nowhere could impact your journey, and every corner you check is unique. Coming in the future, game modes would feature a story capable of changing its experience across thousands of users, remaining fun and non-redudundant.

    <h1><a href="pages/Unreborn.html">Unreborn Sub-games/Mechanic systems</a></h1>
    <p class="description">Unreborn is a game consisting of several other games, all derived from the reusable code and setup given from its main part, the spaceship shooter. They are currently as follows: top-down RPG layout: 0.5/1 done, 2D Platforming Action-RPG combat: 0.2/1 done, Top-down strategy: 0/1 done, more to come. Because the main code can be built upon into several other projects, it creates a vast expansion of sub-games capable of being created.
